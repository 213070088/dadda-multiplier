# Dadda-multiplier
Using verilog, a 16*16 dadda multiplier is created. For final addition, a 32 bit Brent-Kung adder is utilised. The repository includes the test bench and design files. On the test bench, eight sets of random inputs are provided. For the purpose of verifying the design, a golden reference is created, and the actual outcome is compared with the reference. Zero on the flag denotes that the design is valid. Waveform.png displays the waveform.
